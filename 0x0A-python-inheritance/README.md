Python - Inheritance Python Test Cases Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All your files should end with a new line All your test files should be inside a folder tests All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt) All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)') All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.doc)') All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").my_function.doc)' and python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.my_function.doc)') A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified) We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case Documentation Do not use the works import or from inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
